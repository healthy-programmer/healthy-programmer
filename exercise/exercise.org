* Motivation

The body position while sitting on the chair is far away from neutral human body posture. Naturally our muscles, tendons and joints are not developed the way to stay still for longer period of time.
However human body is very adaptive ecosystem and when forced it assimilates slowly to the conditions of the environment. Sitting upright for hours can be very challenging for the neck, upper and lower back.
It requires strong back muscles. But back is not the only body part that is affected. The knees are constantly bent in the sitting position and often positioned in stained angle. The tights, calfs and ankles
are unused and progressively becoming tight and weak.
The shoulders, forearms and wrists are kept rotated for hours from their comfortable state in order to ensure convenience for typing on the keyboard and moving the mouse.
With years some muscles and tendons are slowly getting prolonged and others shortened which may result in muscle/tendon disbalances in the limbs, back and core.
Without moving the muscles are losing their original and natural flexibility. As a result the joints, bones and spine vertebras are now responsible for body support instead of muscles and tendons.
All these factors combined together may result in chronic pain and damage of the musculoskeletal system.
In order to avoid unfavorable body changes caused by incorrect sitting without frequent breaks compensation power exercises and stretching are more than recommended.

* Morning excercise routine

This routine has been developed over 2 years of practice.

** Shoulder mobility with resistance band

This is the first exercise of the day. After the night shoulders and back are often stiff. This is how to bring mobility back.
In order to build a habit exercise must be always a fun. Sometimes I use balance board for this and other exercises.
This stretch is very important for some of the following workouts.
We will do some strengthening exercises as well. And best practice is to strengthen only previously stretched muscles in order
to strengthen it in it's full range of motion. This way the muscle will grow nicely long and will keep flexible.

Result:

- arm behind the shoulder. This is excellent exercise as it un-bends upper back. It is contrary movement/position of the
  upper back to the wrong sitting when upper back is bent forward

** Hamstring stretch, lower and middle back strengthening

In this exercise back is actively bent in the arc (opposite position to incorrect sit).
While bending forward in your hips (not in your lower back) try to keep this
arc position as much as possible. Feet are kept together or slightly aside in parallel.
You should feel hamstring (back side of your legs) stretching
and at the same time you should feel tension in your lower and middle back as you try actively keep arc position.

It's ok if you cannot reach the floor with your hands. With time and repetition you will get to that point. Be patient.
Hamstrings get shortened during long sitting as we keep our knees bent for all day long on the chair.

** Shoulder and chest muscle stretch, gluteus maximus (butt, sitting muscle) strengthening

This exercise addresses shoulder mobility in backward motion and also it stretches chest muscles that are often shortened because of
sitting with upper back and shoulders bent forward.
As you push your hips up actively press sitting muscles together and you are strengthening gluteus maximus.
This muscle often gets weak during long sits.

Tips:

- keep alignment of the feet pointing forward in parallel, not side way

** Quadriceps, Hip flexor, Abs stretch

This is perfect exercise for stretching of the back leg quadriceps and hip flexor. It also stretches abdominal muscles.
At the same time this movement strengthens upper back and shoulders. As you can see and feel this exercise activates
these muscle groups that are negatively affected in sitting position.

Tips:

- repeat the exercise with another leg as well
- keep your legs and hips aligned, both feet are supposed to be pointed forward, not to the side
- alignment to the neutral position is essential and very important for any kind of stretching in general
- if you try to straighten back leg knee the hip flexor stretch will became even more effective you will feel it

Result:

- stretched and so prolonged: quadriceps, hip flexors, abdominal muscles
- strengthened upper, middle back and shoulders

** Shoulder, middle and upper back flexibility / quadriceps and sitting muscles strength

This is another exercise for strengthening your back, stretching your abdominal muscles and exercising arms behind the shoulders
During first excercise keep your arms straight and try to reach the wall with your chest. This will form your back in nice arc.
As you progress you can place your hands lower and lower or you can step more and more backward.

The second exercise is preparation for a bridge / wheel. Here is very important to keep your feet pointing forward in parallel not side ways.
Actively squeeze your sitting muscles together and try to reach as low as possible. Than use your hands to walk up the wall back to
the initial position. This exercise strengthens quadriceps, sitting muscles, your back and shoulders while it stretches your abdominal
muscles.

** Handstand, shoulder flexibility, back mobility and strength

Another way how to train your back and shoulder mobility is handstand exercise because you can use your own weight for putting more pressure
on your "arms behind shoulders" stretch. Be very careful in this exercise. Actively maintain the back arc by using upper and middle back
muscles while you feel stretch in you shoulders, abdominal muscles and also quadriceps muscles.

** Advanced results after 2 years of practices

As I mentioned if you want to build a habit it must be fun and there are funny movements
After 2 years of practicing I was able to do this wall assisted wheel. This advanced exercise require all
the muscle groups (that are affected by sitting: shoulders, upper, middle, lower back, hip flexors, quadriceps, hamstrings, calfs) both stretched and strengthened.
To reach this goal for me this is the winning fight with chairs and sedentary life style.

* Conclusion

I think that these are the compensation exercises to compensate inactive life style on the chair in the office.
No more pain in the lower back pain, no more stiffness in the body.
I never force myself to do full routine every day. But first 5 basic exercises are must. After 2 years of practicing they
are the habit and my body requires them at the morning automatically. Sometimes I do some of them during the day as well if I have a taste
for quick stretch.

I tried more workouts that I do not describe here because I didn't preserve doing them for a longer time.
