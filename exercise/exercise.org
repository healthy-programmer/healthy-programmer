* Motivation

The body position while sitting on the chair is far away from neutral human body posture. Naturally our muscles, tendons and joints are not developed the way to stay still for longer period of time.
However human body is very adaptive ecosystem and when forced it assimilates slowly to the conditions of the environment. Sitting upright for hours can be very challenging for the neck, upper and lower back.
It requires strong back muscles. But back is not the only body part that is affected. The knees are constantly bent in the sitting position and often positioned in stained angle. The tights, calfs and ankles
are unused and progressively becoming tight and weak.
The shoulders, forearms and wrists are kept rotated for hours from their comfortable state in order to ensure convenience for typing on the keyboard and moving the mouse.
With years some muscles and tendons are slowly getting prolonged and others shortened which may result in muscle/tendon disbalances in the limbs, back and core.
Without moving the muscles are losing their original and natural flexibility. As a result the joints, bones and spine vertebras are now responsible for body support instead of muscles and tendons.
All these factors combined together may result in chronic pain and damage of the musculoskeletal system.
In order to avoid unfavorable body changes caused by incorrect sitting without frequent breaks compensation power exercises and stretching are more than recommended.

* Morning excercise routine

This routine has been developed over 2 years of practice.

** Shoulder mobility with resistance band

This is the first exercise of the day. After the night shoulders and back are often stiff. This is how to bring mobility back.
In order to build a habit exercise must be always a fun. Sometimes I use balance board for this and other exercises.
This stretch is very important for some of the following workouts.
We will do some strengthening exercises as well. And best practice is that to strengthen only previously stretched muscles in order
to strengthen it in it's full range of motion. This way the muscle will grow nicely long and will be kept flexible.

Result:

- arm behind the shoulder. This is excellent exercise as it unbends upper back. It is contrary movement/position of the
  upper back to the wrong sitting when upper back is bent forward

** Quadriceps, Hip flexor, Abs stretch

This is perfect exercise for stretching of the back leg quadriceps and hip flexor. It also stretches abdominal muscles.
At the same time this movement strengthens upper back and shoulders. As you can see and feel this exercise activates
these muscle groups that are negatively affected in sitting position.

Tips:

- repeat the exercise with another leg as well
- keep your legs and hips aligned, both feet are supposed to be pointed forward, not to the side
- alignment to the neutral position is essential and very important for any kind of stretching in general
- if you try to straighten back leg knee the hip flexor stretch will became even more effective you will feel it

Result:

- stretched and so prolonged: quadriceps, hip flexors, abdominal muscles
- strengthened upper, middle back and shoulders
