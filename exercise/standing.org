* Standing is an alternative

Motivation:

As I turned 40 I started to have lower back issues.
If I wanted to sit correctly with my back straight it required significant effort for me.
Shortly I realized that human body is not designed for keeping certain body position (sitting in this case) for longer period of time.
The only comfortable positions are those without any effort required, the lying or sitting with bent upper back which is literally
lying on the chair.

I felt a sleepy and resty. I have also realized that my body is inactive for most of the days: 8 hours of sleep, 8 hours of work. 1 hour
in the car. 17 hours minimally inactive.

So I made a an experiment. Standing as an alternative. It required a little training but it is 4 months now and I feel like
I don't want to sit on the chair again.

Benefits:

- shoulders are naturally handing / falling down in the correct position (not bent forward)
- elbows are free, it perfectly fit with my ergonomic keyboard
- my body is active: sitting was a resting position but standing is active
- I do not get sleepy during the work
- My caloric output is double
- My breathing is deep and natural: less depression or anxiety
- I enjoy lunch time sitting
- When I get back home I feel warmed up already and rest of the day is active as well

Effort (Correct standing)

- knees are slightly bent, in order to avoid using joints as support
- toes are pointing forward not to the side
- this requires using a gluteus maximus and quadriceps activated (and this is the part where training was required for me)
- pelvis

Extra:

- I am standing on absorption mat to have this springing feeling that relieves my legs, knees and feet
- From time to time I wave my hips like in dancing to keep my legs fresh

Progress:

- I started with few hours a day firstly
- But than I was able to lengthen the time for entire working day (with lunch break of course when I really enjoyed resting in sit)
