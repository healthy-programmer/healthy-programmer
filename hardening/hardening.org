* Hardening in the cold water

During the winter in our team we've established hardening sessions during the lunch several times per week.
Cold water is very refreshing. It ends any frustration from previous coding in the minute.
After 5 minutes in the freezing water we return to the office charged with new boost of energy feeling good and fresh
for the rest of the day.

I always wanted to have crystal clear working desk and hack in transparent working environment and conditions :)

How we started:

- It's not recommended to start in the winter time straight
- So we started in August when water temperature was over 20
- We kept going to the water 2 or 3 times per week and we didn't stop
- Temperature in the big lake never drops down quickly even if the air temperature drops 10 degrees down suddenly
  In the lake where we use to go it never dropped more than 1 or 2 degrees per week
- Considering frequency of 3 times per week, we trained every 0.5 degree drop

How it works:

- It is important to calm down before immerse
- First minute is the most difficult as the body is fighting in the stress mode, this is also time when
  we switch into survival mode naturally and that's why all the frustration goes away suddenly. We need to survive.
- Than we calm down and naturally start to breathe slowly and deeply.
- Sometimes we swim for a while
- The most fragile part of the body are fingers and toes. Body is shortening blood circuits. It concentrates
  on the body core to keep the temperature of internal organs high. This requires to limit blood circulation in the limbs
  To keep them warm I personally try to do tiny movements with toes and fingers.
- If the water is too cold and your fingers hurt, just get them out of water
  You can play with that and submerge them for a several seconds and switch like this as you feel
- It is good to use cap, there is no fat on your scalp, keep it warm

How long:

- The common rule is so much minutes as the water temperature in degrees of Celsius
- Intermediate hardeners +2, 3 minutes
- Personally if the temperature is over 10, we stay 10, 12, 15 minutes sometimes
- Under the 10 we keep the rule. In 7 degrees we stay from 7 to 10 minutes
- Under 5: we stay 3, 4, 5 minutes
- If I feel good, sometimes I stay 5 minutes in 2.5 degrees
- I never force it. Minutes are not important. After survival of 2 or 3 minutes it has no extra health benefits to stay longer

Frequency:

- once per week is enough to get health benefits
- we never go more than 3 times per week

After the bath:

- It is important to exercise. It is well known to do simple warming exercises for the same amount of minutes as we kept in the water.
- Exercise restarts the blood circulation into limbs, fingers and toes.
- It warms up entire body.
- After the cold bath muscles are stiff and joints are fragile. So it is better avoid running.
- It is good to drink hot tea for warming ourselves as well.
- Shivering is normal, body tries to shake muscles to worm itself. The better exercise the less shivering

Previously mentioned is trainable:

- with time going, 1st minute will not be so shocking as in the beginning
- your fingers and toes become more resistant and will not hurt as before
- reduced or no shivering later on

My second vs first season

- almost no shivering
- no need of tea but if I have a chance a have one with me
- no towel, I get dry naturally and dress up when I am dry
- hands under water for 5 minutes is no problem any more

Benefits:

- inflammation protection / reduction. If you have some small inflammation in your body it will be eliminated
  and some people claim that you get 6 days protection or risk reduction of the inflammation processes in the body
  that's why you feel that your energy and health boosted after hardening procedure
- dark fat increase that body burns every time you expose low temperature
  as a consequence you will never need to dress so much anymore, you will get more resistant to cold weather
- immune system improvements
- good mood, no frustration, calm nature
- instant moment with just being, no thinking (Wim Hof's words)

What we never do:

- we never put our heads under the water
- we never submerge under the ice

Personally I am doing this second winter season (2022) and I never get sick.
If we do not step into cold water, we walk in shorts and T-shirts even in the freezing temperatures to the near canteen to get the lunch.
and we use this air hardening as an alternative.

Some of us are also fans of Wim Hof breathing method that is in fact meditation with all its health improving benefits.
This 11 minutes long guided breathing session is good to be done before stepping into the water.
