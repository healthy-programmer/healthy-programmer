* Hardening in the cold water

During the winter in our team we've established hardening sessions during the lunch several times per week.
Cold water is very refreshing. It ends any frustration from previous coding in the minute.
After 5 minutes in the freezing water we return to the office charged with new boost of energy feeling good and fresh
for the rest of the day.

Personally I am doing this second winter season (2022) and I never get sick.
If we do not step into cold water, we walk in shorts and T-shirts even in the freezing temperatures to the near canteen to get the lunch.
and we use this air hardening as an alternative.

I always wanted to have crystal clear working desk and hack in transparent working environment and conditions :)

Some of us are also fun of Wim Hof breathing method that is in fact meditation with all its health improving benefits.
This 11 minutes long guided breathing session is good to be done before stepping into the water.
