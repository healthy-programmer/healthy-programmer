* Keep playing/learning - effective dealing with frustration

Tasks on the projects are not always funny thing to do. Sometimes they cause lot of frustration and not just from the time schedule perspective.
There are types of tasks that are time consuming and technologically boring. But at the same time they are very important for the project and maybe
the most important for the project. For me implementation of the custom reports are these type of tasks. Reports and letter templates.
They don't bring any new technical knowledge and don't bring any emotional satisfaction. Human brain is naturally starving for the new knowledge.
But writing the reports don't bring anything new. Once the initial database query is optimized, which is the most interesting part of the task,
rest of the work is about binding query result into final excel columns, playing with the formatting and layouts, sometimes extra calculation of
fields that are not directly part of the query result. At the same time reports, letters and other system outcomes are the most important
functionality as these are published out of the system to the customers (letters) and third parties (reports) and therefore should be implemented properly.

** Play

When I am on this type of tasks I cannot focus for along time and I tend to lose my focus quite often. In these situations I found very
effective to have ready useful alternatives for quick relax and recovery. Instead of browsing the social networks that is very time consuming
and passive way of relax not related to my programming profession I found very effective alternative that comes from my hobby and interest
and still it is related to my job. It can vary from person to person. For me it is fast typing practice. Personally I have dedicated
workspace for relaxing with these 2 pages ready to serve.

The point is when I already lost the focus still I am doing something active and helpful. Typing faster and more precisely is benefit for
the future and this skill is definitely worthy to be gradually improved. And as this is an active relax, few minutes is enough to recharge
the batteries.

** Learn

Recently I inherited tasks to contribute already existing reports implemented by former colleagues.
Task was to optimize query and then to extend excel outcome with new columns.
After a short period of time I found out that optimization means to rewrite original database query completely because it was wrongly implemented.
I also needed to adjust data model at the first place, than implement the data intervention scripts and execute them on production data
in order to be able to simplify the query for faster execution.
Some reports I needed to rewrite completely including the column binding. What is more frustrated than implementation of
boring tasks and in addition not from scratch but to study someone else's code and optimize it?

During the pair programming session we decided to rewrite some part of the implementation into new language (clojure). Original implementation
was in Java/Groovy. Clojure is a language for lisp code than runs in JVM. All Java libraries can be used in it and at the same time
still we can use functional rather than object oriented paradigm. Depression changed into challenging euphoria immediately. I will learn
something new (new language) but what's more important shortly we found that report implementation in Clojure is much more effective
less time consuming because Clojure enables us to reload scripts or functions with their new version in JVM instantly without need of server restart.
Once the interface is set between Java core application and Clojure extension code server doesn't need to be restarted at all. And we can
focus on query implementation and column binding in new language.

Conclusion here is that sometimes it is possible to benefit from despair by changing the approach.
