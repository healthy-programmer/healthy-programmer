* Natural body position while sitting

This is how I sit behind normal keyboard. My shoulders were leaned forward as I wanted to ensure comfort position for my wrists.

When I tried to sit straight, my wrists felt uncomfortable because of the unnatural bend and internal rotation of the forearm.

I tried to investigate what is the natural position of wrists while person sit straight. And I found nothing new. Thumbs are pointing up. Forearms are not internally rotated. And hands are naturally
positioned apart at the shoulder distance. In this position shoulders do not fall into internal rotation and back hump.

That's why I have chosen split keyboard. In order to eliminate internal forearm rotation I built wrist supporting holders leading my forearms to their neutral position.

This is how I cheaply built wrist supporting holders from wooden plates originally used as cutting boards in my wife's kitchen. [[file:./keyboard.org][Link]]

*Note* I have received very useful feedback from my friend that on the previous picture my forearms are touching the edge of the table and my ulnar nerve is stimulated.
In long term it could end up with cubital tunnel syndrome. This can be avoided for example by raising the chair level. Now my arms are naturally hanging.
Alternatively they can be just slightly touching the table surface.
