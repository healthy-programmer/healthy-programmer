* Traditional and split keyboard compare

This is how I sit behind normal keyboard. My shoulders were leaned forward as I wanted to ensure comfort position for my wrists.

When I tried to sit straight, my wrists felt uncomfortable because of the unnatural bend and internal rotation of the forearm.

I tried to investigate what is the natural position of wrists while person sit straight. And I found nothing new. Thumbs are pointing up. Forearms are not internally rotated. And hands are naturally
positioned apart at the shoulder distance. In this position shoulders do not fall into internal rotation and back hump.

That's why I have chosen split keyboard. In order to eliminate internal forearm rotation I built wrist supporting holders leading my forearms to their neutral position.

This is how I cheaply built wrist supporting holders from wooden plates originally used as cutting boards in my wife's kitchen. [[file:./keyboard.org][Link]]
