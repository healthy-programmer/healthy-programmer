* My motivation for ergonomic keyboard

The keyboard selected and the supporting wrist holders satisfies these physiological axioms:

- neutral positing of the back is straight (not bent in the upper nor lower part)
- neutral position of the the shoulders is pushed back (not leaned forward)
- neutral position of wrists when sitting with elbows bent is with thump pointing up, not to the inner side

Based on these I understood that I need

- split keyboard that allows me to type without shoulders internally rotated (that leads to unwanted shoulder forward bending)
- 40 degrees rotated wrist holders that eliminate wrist rotation

Keyboard chosen is: Iris:

* Construction

For holder assembly these material is needed:

- 4 pieces of wooden plates (I used kitchen cutting board :o) from local manufacturer here in Slovakia for 5 EUR/piece), size: 150 x 250 x 10 millimeters that perfectly fit for iris keyboard
- 4 metal bars with threads (for screws). I used 80 millimeter long bars.
- 4 screws fitting metal bar threads
- 4 self-tapping screws

and this tools were used:

- saw
- drill
- screw driver

** Assembly procedcure

*** Bottom part

1) Two wooden plates are supposed to be used for bottom part and all I did with them was drilling 2 holes 15 millimeters from the inner border.
2) Than I mounted 2 bars to each bottom piece using screws.

*** Wrist supporting pads

1) Each wrist pad consists of 2 pieces.
2) Upper piece was created by sawing the wooden plate with angle copying the shape of the keyboard
3) Lower piece is just leftover from step 2.
4) Last thing I needed to do is to screw bottom part, lower and upper pad parts (3 layers) together with small  self-tapping screws from the bottom side. Here be careful and use thin self-tapping screws. Screw them slowly to avoid wood cracks.
