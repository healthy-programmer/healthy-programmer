* Keyboard

The keyboard selected and the supporting wrist holders satisfies these physiological axioms:

- neutral positing of the back is straight (not bent in the upper nor lower part)
- neutral position of the the shoulders is pushed back (not lean forward)
- neutral position of wrists when sitting with elbows bent is with thump pointing up, not to the inner side

Based on these I understood that I need

- split keyboard that allows me to type without shoulders internally rotated (that leads to unwanted shoulder forward bending)
- 40 degrees wrist holders that eliminate wrist rotation

I will write more about this topic later.
For now here is result of my research.

Keyboard chosen is: Iris:
