* My motivation for ergonomic keyboard

The keyboard selected and the supporting wrist holders satisfies these physiological axioms:

- neutral positing of the back is straight (not bent in the upper nor lower part)
- neutral position of the the shoulders is pushed back (not leaned forward)
- neutral position of wrists when sitting with elbows bent is with thump pointing up, not to the inner side

Based on these I understood that I need

- split keyboard that allows me to type without shoulders internally rotated (that leads to unwanted shoulder forward bending)
- 40 degrees rotated wrist holders that eliminate wrist rotation

Keyboard chosen is: Keebio Iris

* Construction

For holder assembly these material is needed:

- 4 pieces of wooden plates (I used kitchen cutting board :o) from local manufacturer here in Slovakia for 5 EUR/piece), size: 150 x 250 x 10 millimeters that perfectly fit for iris keyboard
- 4 metal bars with threads (for screws). I used 80 millimeter long bars.
- 4 screws fitting metal bar threads
- 4 self-tapping screws
- 2 pieces of wooden pin (avoiding the keyboard slip from the sloping bottom part of the holder)

and this tools were used:

- saw
- drill
- screw driver
- glue (fast drying superglue)

* Assembly procedcure

** Bottom part

1) Two wooden plates are supposed to be used for bottom part and all I did with them was drilling 2 holes 15 millimeters from the inner border.
2) Than I mounted 2 bars to each bottom piece using screws.

** Wrist supporting pads

1) Each wrist pad consists of 2 pieces.
2) Upper piece was created by sawing the wooden plate with angle copying the shape of the keyboard
3) Lower piece is just leftover from step 2.
4) I used the glue to put these pieces together.

** Putting them together

1) Finally I screwed bottom part and wrist supporting part together with small self-tapping screws from the bottom side. Here be careful and use thin self-tapping screws. Screw them slowly to avoid wood cracks.
2) Last thing I needed to do was gluing the wooden pins to the outside edge of the holder. This prevents the keyboard from slipping.

*Note* The reason why I glued top and middle part (instead of screwing all 3 pieces together) is that shorter and thinner self-tapping screws are sufficient consequently. And the reason why I didn't glue all
3 pieces together is that wrist tap still can be unmounted in the future and the leg screw on the bottom part is accessible for the leg replacement for example if you decide to change the slopping angle.
